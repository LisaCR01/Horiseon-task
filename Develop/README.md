# Horiseon Task

In this task I was required to refactor existing code to meet a certain set of standard for a marketing agency who wanted to make their existing website more accessible.

## Criteria that I met to achieve this

* The use of semantic HTML elements.

**Before**
![Before use of HTML semantic elements](./HTML_semantic_element_before.jpeg?raw=true )

**After**
![Use of HTML semantic elements](./HTML_semantic_element_after.jpeg?raw=true )

* Logically structured HTML elements that are independent of styling and positioning.


**Before**



* The icon and image elements all have accessible alt attributes.

**Before**
![Accessible alt attribute](./Accessible_Alt_Attribute_Before.jpeg?raw=true)
**After**
![Accessible alt attribute](./Accessible_Alt_Attribute_After.jpeg?raw=true)
* The heading attributes fall in subsequential order



* The title element is concise and descriptive
